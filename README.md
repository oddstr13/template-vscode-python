Licensing
---------

The contents of this template repository is not really original enough to be copyrightable, and I would prefer that you pick your own license.

If you want licensing recommendations, I would suggest one of the following:

* [**GPL**][GPLv3]: Strong copyleft, viral. Best to avoid this one for libraries - use [**LGPL**][LGPLv3] instead.
* [**MPL**][MPLv2]: Strong copyleft – applied per file.
* [**MIT**][MIT]: Preserve copyright notice and license file – no other requirements.
* [**Unlicense**][Unlicense]: Public domain dedication. No requirements at all. The license used on this repo.

Many other choices are available, see [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) and [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/)

The license is usually applied by placing it in a file named `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.txt` or `COPYING`, but is placed here in this repo for easier application of your own license on your project.
